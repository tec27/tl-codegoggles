#TL CodeGoggles
##Chrome Extension for a Better [TeamLiquid.net](http://teamliquid.net) Code Viewing/Editing Experience

Utilizes a combination of [ACE](http://ace.ajax.org/) (slightly modified to work better in an injected extension) and [HighlightJS](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/) (for language detection only).

At this point in time the extension only deals with syntax highlighting within posts, but integrating ACE for code blocks during editing is coming very soon!
